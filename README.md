# Contrastive Explanations for Explaining Model Adaptations

This repository contains the implementation of the methods proposed in the paper [Contrastive Explanations for Explaining Model Adaptations](paper.pdf) by Andr√© Artelt, Fabian Hinder, Valerie Vaquet, Robert Feldhans and Barbara Hammer -- note that the version in this paper is an extended version of the IWANN-2021 conference paper (e.g. more experiments, a new section on regularizing model adaptations, etc.).

The experiments as described in the paper are implemented in the folder [Code](Code/).

## Implementation of the different experiments

### Comparing Counterfactuals for Explaining Model Adaptation

#### Gaussian Blobs

Implemented in `Code/model_feature_drift.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.

#### Predicting House Prices

Implemented in `Code/model_drift_regression.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.

#### Coffee

Implemented in `Code/experiments_on_coffee.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.

Note that the data set can not be published.

#### Human Activity Recognition

Implemented in `Code/model_drift_har.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.

Note that the data set is to large to be uploaded.

#### Loan approval

Implementation can be found in `Code/model_drift_credit.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.



### Finding Relevant Regions in Data Space

#### Gaussian Blobs

Implemented in `Code/model_feature_drift.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.

In order to use the most important samples only, you have to comment out lines 69 and 87, uncomment lines 70 and 88 -- you might also want to change the path of the computed plot.

#### Human Activity Recognition

Implemented in `Code/model_drift_har.py` -- the script does not need any arguments.

In order to use the most important samples only, you have to comment out line 146, uncomment line 147 -- you might also want to change the path of the computed plot.


### Persistent Local Explanations

Implementation can be found in `Code/model_drift_credit.py` -- the script does not need any arguments. There is a global variable in the script `regularization` -- if `True`, a regularization for preventing unwanted changes in the internal reasoning is used (default is `False`).
